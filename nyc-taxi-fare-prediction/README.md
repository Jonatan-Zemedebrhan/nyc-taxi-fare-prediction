# Fare Modeling in Practice — A Regression-Based Approach to NYC Taxi Pricing

## 📊 Project Summary

This project builds a multiple linear regression model to predict NYC taxi fares based on pre-ride features.  
It was completed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics program.

### 🔍 Key Steps
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering (e.g., mean_distance, rush_hour)
- Model building with scikit-learn
- Residual analysis and model evaluation (R² ≈ 0.87)

### ✅ Key Findings
- Distance and duration are the strongest predictors
- Rush hour and vendor have minor but visible effects
- Model is interpretable and deployable for real-time fare estimates
